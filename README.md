# Indy.Net
Indy.Net is a DLL search tool for the .NET framework.  It lets you search for names of items (such as classes or methods) in all DLLs recursively (by default) under a folder.

## Why though?
A couple reasons that spring to mind:
  * You have to work with a NuGet package or bindrop that has more DLLs than you want to deal with, and the documentation doesn't tell you which one contains the thing you want.
  * You're following a tutorial online, their sample code has a ton of namespace imports, and you have no idea which one the thing you want lives in.
  
## When will this be 1.0?
Once there are no IL constructs that Indy can't search for.
